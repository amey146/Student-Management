# Student Management 
The Student Management System aims to streamline the attendance tracking and test reporting process. It will mark student attendance in real-time as they enter the classroom and send immediate notifications to parents. Additionally, it will generate detailed daily or weekly test performance reports, including marks and grades, accessible to both teachers and parents. The system will enhance communication and efficiency in monitoring student performance.
